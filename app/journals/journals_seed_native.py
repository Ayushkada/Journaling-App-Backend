    "content": "Day 1 check-in. I’m not trying to be poetic today; I’m trying to be specific. Here’s what happened and what I decided to do about it. Here’s the concrete list I’m tracking and adjusting. It’s not a punishment; it’s an experiment in being someone I can rely on: - [ ] Smile practice for 3 minutes (mirror, eyes soft, friendly) - [ ] Start one conversation with curiosity first - [ ] No porn today; redirect to a walk or shower talk - [ ] Workout 5x/week, use basement if gym fails - [ ] Reply to texts within an hour if possible - [ ] Cap Instagram and YouTube at 30 minutes each; choose learning over noise - [ ] Eat within 30 minutes of waking; target four balanced meals - [ ] Run ~1 mile each morning or replace with a brisk walk - [ ] Keep a small list of conversation prompts - [ ] Shower talk: 10 minutes, pick one topic and explore - [ ] Morning coffee, mouth tape at night, water flosser, basic skincare - [ ] Make the bed right after waking - [ ] Brainstorm jokes/ideas; keep a running capture list - [ ] Apply to jobs for at least one focused hour - [ ] Study for the cloud cert; micro-sprints daily - [ ] Ship something in the app every day, even small - [ ] Website refresh: one section at a time - [ ] Don’t quit on hard days; lower the target, keep the rep The money anxiety crept in while I brushed my teeth. Numbers I don’t like. Debts I wish I didn’t have. I opened the spreadsheet anyway and forced the cells into the light. When I actually wrote dates and minimums, the monster shrank by about twenty percent. It’s still ugly, but it now has edges and arithmetic. I promised myself: no impulse delivery food this week, brew coffee at home, and funnel the difference to the smallest balance first. That tiny plan gave me a sliver of calm I could actually breathe around. Toward evening the loneliness crept in. I wanted to disappear into noise—music, videos, anything—but I chose a softer approach: texted a friend a simple “coffee this week?” and left it there. I’m trying to build social muscle like I build physical muscle: small sets, consistent form, rest between. I looked at the list of goals I’ve been avoiding and I picked one tiny thing I could do in under five minutes. Then I did it. I worked on the journaling app analysis module. I refactored the pipeline that reads messy text and tries to be helpful without pretending to be a therapist. I normalized emoji tokens to uppercase and stripped duplicates so “(SAD)(angry)(SAD)” doesn’t throw the heuristics off. I added basic sentiment bucketing, but more importantly I wired in a gentle rule-based pass that flags phrases like “so lonely,” “no one cares,” or “it’s all my fault” and nudges a next step: text a friend, stand in sunlight for two minutes, or write one sentence about something in my control. No magical thinking, just rails. By the end of the day, I don’t feel “fixed.” I don’t even feel good, exactly. What I feel is slightly more trustworthy to myself. A tiny bit more likely to do what I said I’d do, even when no one is watching. I can live with that. If tomorrow is heavier, I’ll still get up, still eat, still move, still write, still ship something. Systems over mood. That’s the plan I can carry when I don’t like myself much, and the plan that will make future-me a little less heavy to be. Nutrition was better, which probably helped my mood stay more level. Four meals, nothing fancy: oatmeal with peanut butter, chicken and rice, yogurt with honey, pasta with olive oil and garlic. I drank water like it’s a job. I’m trying to add a pound or two a week, not because I think a number will fix emptiness, but because feeling strong might lower the volume on the constant background doubt. It’s actually easier to think when the body has fuel. In the afternoon, I wrote measurable bullets for my resume. Not “helped with frontend,” but “reduced load time by ~30% by trimming bundles and caching API responses.” Not “worked with the team,” but “aligned three content types with product in two sprints without rework.” It’s weird",

I practiced a small smile while passing neighbors; I’m trying to relearn how my face works when I’m not braced for impact.

Someone cut the line and my brain tried to throw a courtroom drama. I stepped aside, breathed, and let the urge burn out. No snark, no story about respect. I left with what I came for and without the side quest. That felt like a grown-up skill, one I want to keep. I did my “no music shower, talk out loud” drill for ten minutes. Today’s topic was conversations: asking better questions, keeping answers short, and making room for silence without rescuing it with rambling. It’s uncomfortable, but I’d rather be uncomfortable in private on purpose than be blindsided in public.

Social media tempted me with the usual trapdoor comparisons. I actually caught my thumb hovering over the app and asked out loud, “Is this going to help?” Then I set a 30-minute timer and stuck to it.

Four meals, nothing fancy: oatmeal with peanut butter, chicken and rice, yogurt with honey, pasta with olive oil and garlic. I drank water like it’s a job.

I did my “no music shower, talk out loud” drill for ten minutes. Today’s topic was conversations: asking better questions, keeping answers short, and making room for silence without rescuing it with rambling. It’s uncomfortable, but I’d rather be uncomfortable in private on purpose than be blindsided in public. After, I wrote a short list of topics I can reach for when my mind blanks: gym form tips, a podcast I liked, the new coffee place, a question about someone’s weekend, something I learned while studying cloud networking.

    "content": "Day 16 check-in. I’m not trying to be poetic today; I’m trying to be specific. Here’s what happened and what I decided to do about it. Social media tempted me with the usual trapdoor comparisons. I actually caught my thumb hovering over the app and asked out loud, “Is this going to help?” Then I set a 30-minute timer and stuck to it. When the timer rang, I put the phone down and went for a five-minute walk, just to prove to myself that I’m the one steering, even on boring streets. It’s not heroic, but consistency is a louder brag than any late-night motivational rant. The money anxiety crept in while I brushed my teeth. Numbers I don’t like. Debts I wish I didn’t have. I opened the spreadsheet anyway and forced the cells into the light. When I actually wrote dates and minimums, the monster shrank by about twenty percent. It’s still ugly, but it now has edges and arithmetic. I promised myself: no impulse delivery food this week, brew coffee at home, and funnel the difference to the smallest balance first. That tiny plan gave me a sliver of calm I could actually breathe around. I did my “no music shower, talk out loud” drill for ten minutes. Today’s topic was conversations: asking better questions, keeping answers short, and making room for silence without rescuing it with rambling.

No snark, no story about respect. I left with what I came for and without the side quest. That felt like a grown-up skill, one I want to keep. Here’s the concrete list I’m tracking and adjusting. It’s not a punishment; it’s an experiment in being someone I can rely on: - [ ] Smile practice for 3 minutes (mirror, eyes soft, friendly) - [ ] Start one conversation with curiosity first - [ ] No porn today; redirect to a walk or shower talk - [ ] Workout 5x/week, use basement if gym fails - [ ] Reply to texts within an hour if possible - [ ] Cap Instagram and YouTube at 30 minutes each; choose learning over noise - [ ] Eat within 30 minutes of waking; target four balanced meals - [ ] Run ~1 mile each morning or replace with a brisk walk - [ ] Keep a small list of conversation prompts - [ ] Shower talk: 10 minutes, pick one topic and explore - [ ] Morning coffee, mouth tape at night, water flosser, basic skincare - [ ] Make the bed right after waking - [ ] Brainstorm jokes/ideas; keep a running capture list - [ ] Apply to jobs for at least one focused hour - [ ] Study for the cloud cert; micro-sprints daily - [ ] Ship something in the app every day, even small - [ ] Website refresh: one section at a time - [ ] Don’t quit on hard days; lower the target, keep the rep Nutrition was better, which probably helped my mood stay more level. Four meals, nothing fancy: oatmeal with peanut butter, chicken and rice, yogurt with honey, pasta with olive oil and garlic. I drank water like it’s a job. I’m trying to add a pound or two a week, not because I think a number will fix emptiness, but because feeling strong might lower the volume on the constant background doubt. It’s actually easier to think when the body has fuel. Woke up already negotiating with the alarm clock. I lay there for a while staring at the ceiling, counting the tiny dots in the paint and pretending that counting is the same as progress. It isn’t, but it did slow the spin for a minute. I pulled the covers back and reminded myself that today doesn’t have to be dramatic to be useful; it just has to be honest.
